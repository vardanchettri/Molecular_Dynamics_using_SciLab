# Molecular Dynamics using Scilab

This project implements a simple **Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulation** in **Scilab**. This simulation uses the **Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential** and supports **Velocity Verlet integration** with **Periodic Boundary Conditions (PBCs)**.

---

## Features

- **Velocity Verlet Algorithm** –  integrates particle trajectories in time.
- **Periodic Boundary Conditions** – Simulates system by wrapping particles across boundaries.
- **Lennard-Jones Potential** – Models interatomic interactions with a simple potential.
- **Customizable Parameters** – adjustable number of particles, simulation steps, and box size.
- **Visualization** – Basic plotting of particle positions and energy evolution over time.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- **Scilab** 
- Basic understan of lattice structure and potential and LJ graph will be  helpful but not required.

### Running the Code

1. Open Scilab.
2. Load the main MD script:  


Run the Molecular Dynamics simulation
```
exec('molecular_dynamics.sci')
```
